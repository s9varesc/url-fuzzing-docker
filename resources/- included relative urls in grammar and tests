- included relative urls in grammar and tests
- can run wpt url parsing tests on the instrumented browsers
- experiment planning: tribble-modes have a very minor if any influence on the resulting coverage, for detailed evaluation use a tribble-mode that generates a similar number of tests as the wpt tests(~430) but also keep track of the smalles test set achieving similar coverage
- improvements to the result presentation


if you don't have any objections i'd like to officially register the thesis soon
